# Sigmoid toolkit

This is a repo with the numerical scripts used in the study of the SM-dg family of curves.

## Installation and dependencies

### pip

These scripts depend on a few numerical python libraries like scipy and numpy. To install them you need the python module pip.

To obtain pip, please follow the guide at:

```
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
```

### Requirements

After obtaining a functional instance of pip, in the trunk of repo you will find a file named `requirements.txt`.

To install all the needed libraries to run these scripts open a terminal and run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Wait for the installation of all libraries to finish. 


### Configuration

To configure the general behaiviour of all scripts that currently exist and might be developed in the future, please use the `config.json` file available in the repo. It's general structure should look something like this:

```json
{
  "t0": 0.0,
  "t_final": 1.2,
  "initial_alpha": 1e-14,
  "n_terms_taylor": 1,
  "csv_delimiter": "\t",
  "param_finder_props": {
    "d_min": 0,
    "g_min": 0.5,
    "mu_min": 0.0,

    "d_max": 3,
    "g_max": 2.5,
    "mu_max": 2,

    "g_ini": 1,
    "d_ini": 2,
    "mu_ini": 0.5,

    "shift_time": 0

  }
}
```

`t0` Ð¸ `t_final` set the integration interval for the numerical integrator.


## Scripts 

### Parameter finder

This script uses non-linear least squares to fit the best values for D and g for tab-separated dataset.

Usage

```bash
python3 parameter_finder.py <path_to_input_file.csv>
```

The first column in the tab-seperated list should be the values of the time coordinate and the second - the values for alpha.
